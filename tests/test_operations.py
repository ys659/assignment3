""" 
tests/test_operations.py 

This module contains unit tests for the Operations class, which performs basic arithmetic 
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By utilizing 
parameterized tests with pytest, we can efficiently test multiple scenarios with 
different input values, ensuring that each method behaves as expected under various conditions.

Parameterized tests help in reducing code duplication and enhancing test coverage by allowing 
the same test logic to run with different inputs and expected outcomes.

Prerequisites:
- Understanding of Python classes and methods.
- Basic knowledge of pytest framework.
